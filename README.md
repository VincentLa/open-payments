# Open Payments

This repository will host project related to Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)'s Open Payments program: https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/

Open Payments is a program that was initialized by the Affordable Care Act aimed to increase public awareness of financial relationships between drug and device manufacturers and certain health care providers. 

In this repository, we will build out data visualizations or search tool(s) to better present the data that that CMS has made publicly available. Some ideas include

1. Geographical Heat Maps
2. Search tools by NPI/Dollar Amount/Geographic Location
3. Start with something like a heat map showing payment "hot spots" geographically, and then let people zoom in until at some point they see a list of actual providers and the money they get (and can be done various ways, e.g. by the payer, or by type of provider, etc...)? So at a big picture level you would see something like a map, and at the granular level it would be something more like a zillow map of house values.
